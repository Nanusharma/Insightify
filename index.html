            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project focuses on creating a digit recognition system using the famous MNIST dataset. The model is trained on handwritten digits (0-9) and can predict which digit is drawn on the canvas. This system is implemented using machine learning techniques, and the frontend allows users to draw digits for prediction.</p>

            <h2>Use Cases</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Educational Tool:</strong> This tool can be used by students to understand how digit recognition works through interactive learning.</li>
                <li><strong>OCR Systems:</strong> It can serve as a base model for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems that interpret handwritten text.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Forms:</strong> Useful for scanning handwritten forms where digits need to be recognized quickly and accurately.</li>
                <li><strong>Assistive Technology:</strong> Can assist people with disabilities by allowing them to input digits in a non-typing manner.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="features">
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interactive Canvas:</strong> Draw digits on the canvas, and the system will recognize them in real-time.</li>
                <li><strong>Trained Model:</strong> The model is trained using the MNIST dataset, which contains thousands of handwritten digit samples.</li>
                <li><strong>Instant Feedback:</strong> Predictions are displayed instantly after the user inputs a digit.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear Interface:</strong> Simple and intuitive design for ease of use.</li>
            </ul>
